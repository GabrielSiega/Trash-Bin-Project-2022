# Trash-Bin-Project-2022
ITE E-Dustbin Project

Learning Task

One of the challenge this is rising is the amount of generated waste and littering due to high demand for food products and other essentials. Public litter bins are filling up in a blink of an eye causing bins end up over flowing before collected. This doing not only cluttered streets and bad odour but also negative health and environment impact but also create a risk of rodent problem. 

You as a head engineer is to build a smart waste collection system. The smart waste collection system is able to send out alerts/notifications when the bin are nearly full. In doing so, it create a move that is expected to improve efficiency in the industry. This means that the waste collectors will have the option of collecting refuse every two to three days if the bins are not full, instead of collecting them daily.

The device should be compact enough to be installed onto the bin.


Sensing:

Sensor 1 is to be used to provide read-time data on the trash level from the bin. 
Sensor 2 is detect temperature in the bin.

Functionality:

The mobile application/dashboard should be able to indicate the real-time bin level. (E.g. Empty, Half-filled, Full, etc…)
Temperature to be read from mobile application/dashboard.
When the trash bin is near to full, notification/email will be send to the user’s mobile phone.
When bin detect unusual high temperature in the bin, notification/email will also be send to the mobile phone.
It is a bonus if your prototype can interface with any of the open data platform to analyse.

Assignment:

Present a proposal to the management a smart waste collection system that meets the requirement.
Do a project planning schedule to achieve the project completion within foru weeks.
Select the right sensors, indicators, software (dashboard), etc.
Provide a schematic diagram on the hardware design of the smart waste collection system.
Plan a flowchart of the programming sequence of events.
Code a working program.
Perform functional test on the prototype.
Carry out troubleshooting of the prototype (when necessary).
Demonstrate the prototype and working program to your supervisor.
Prepare a simple project report (maximum 10 pages) that includes the following:
Introduction, descriptions, specification and conclusion.
Troubleshooting techniques
Hardware schematic diagram 
Component list 
Program coding / Working principles of hardware and software interface

Present your final project to the management
